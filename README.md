# StackTimers

**An Educational, Non-Profit Project by David de Alencar**

## About

StackTimers is a study project inspired by the fantastic Pomofocus.io, which influenced both the design choices (with its caracteristic monochromatic theme) and the functionalities.

My primary objective with StackTimers is to put into practice the knowledge and techniques I've acquired during my journey in frontend development, by recreating an app that is very present in my daily routine.

## Usage

StackTimers is a simple app that allow users to create multiple concurrent timers, making it a tool for various time-management needs.

## Technologies

- **React:** StackTimers is built with React. To efficiently manage the app's state, `useContext` and `useReducer` were used.

- **TailWindCSS:** To style the app, I decided to use TailWind.

- **FramerMotion:** To add a dynamic touch, I've opted to use Framer Motion for animating the modal window.

Feel free to explore the project. If you have any feedback, I'd be glad to hear!
